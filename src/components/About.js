            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.</p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

                JavaScript (ES6+)
                TypeScript
                React
                Eleventy
                Node.js
                WordPress</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default About
